Based on [Chapter 3](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-00-common-programming-concepts.html) examples from the official Rust documentation.

This is a simple program to show basic programming concepts like:
  - variables and mutability;
  - data types;
  - functions;
  - control flow.

## Starting

```bash
# compile the program and download required dependencies
cargo build

# run
cargo run

# optional: build documentation of dependencies in use
cargo doc --open
```
